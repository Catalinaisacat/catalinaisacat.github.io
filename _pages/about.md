<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I am Shucheng. I am a rising senior from NYU Shanghai, majoring in Neuroscience (Honor track). I‚Äôm privileged to work on computational cognitive neuroscience under mentorship of Prof. Wei Ji Ma, Prof. Zhong-Lin Lu and Prof. Xing Tian.

I am specifically interested in how the human brain proceeds and reacts upon information, which includes making predictions, selecting important information(attention), translating information into organized knowledge(perception), storing information(memory), as well as amazing higher cognitive processes such as problem-solving, planning, learning and self-evaluation(metacognition).

To tackle these questions, I prefer using a combination of behavioral/psychophysical experiments, computational models and neural recordings.

I am seeking a Ph.D. position in Cognitive Science after my graduation in Fall 2025.
